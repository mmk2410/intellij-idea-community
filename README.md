You can report issues, questions or feedback concerning the package [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mmk2410/intellij-idea-community). If relevant, please include which version

## Updating the package

The update process is nowadays completely automated. Therefore, I cannot  accept merge requests for updating the package to a new version. If there is any issue with the updating system, feel free to create an issue [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mmk2410/intellij-idea-community).

### Setting up the build environment

Run `sudo apt install build-dep debhelper`.

It is also necessary to setup Git with your username and email address as explained in numerous tutorials.

### Updating the package

Run `./update-new-version.sh "$new-version"`

Where `$new-version` is in the format `[year].[major].[minor]`.
